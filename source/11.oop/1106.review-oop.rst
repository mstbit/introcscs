Review Questions
====================

#. What is the relationship between "student1" (line# 9) and class Student? 

.. code-block:: csharp
    :linenos:

    using System;
    public class Student {
        public string name;
    }

    public class GFG {
        static public void Main()
        {
            Student student1 = new Student();
            // Student student2 = new Student();
            // Student student3 = new Student();
            student1.name = "Doris";
            Console.WriteLine("student1.name: " + student1.name);
        }
    }

#. In the preceding code, if you uncomment student2 and student3 (line# 10, 11), 
   will the code execute without error?

#. Inherit from the following class Shape to create two derived classes: Triangle and Rectangle. 
   
.. code-block:: csharp

       public abstract class Shape
    {
        public abstract double GetArea();
        public abstract void Draw();
    }
