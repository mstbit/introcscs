#. What is the relationship between "student1" (line# 9) and class Student? 

    .. code-block:: csharp
        :linenos:

        using System;
        public class Student {
            public string name;
        }

        public class GFG {
            static public void Main()
            {
                Student student1 = new Student();
                // Student student2 = new Student();
                // Student student3 = new Student();
                student1.name = "Doris";
                Console.WriteLine("student1.name: " + student1.name);
            }
        }

#. In the preceding code, if you uncomment student2 and student3 (line# 10, 11), 
   will the code execute without error?

#. Perform the following tasks:
   #. Inherit from the following abstract class Shape to create two derived classes: Triangle and Rectangle. 
   #. Implement the method so that Triangle and Rectangle are able to calculate the areas respectively. 
   #. Prepare the three classes in a file called Shape.cs and run the code from the method in Program.cs. 
   #. Note that in the derived classes you may need to design fields in addition to implementing the method. 

   
    .. code-block:: csharp

        public abstract class Shape
        {
            public abstract double GetArea();
        }
