Files As Streams
============================ 


In most real world scenarios, especially in business settings, operations carried 
out with computers and information systems usually involve data processing and  
may generate new data as a result. To make the data *persistent* past the end of 
program execution, data are stored  in file system or databases (for structured data). Although a 
database maybe preferred in many cases, there will be times that you need to read and write files 
for various purposes.  

A file is a collection of data stored on in a storage device with a name and 
directory path information. A file is stored in your file system, which is part of 
the operating system (OS), and the OS therefore has the information about the file 
and how to access it. 

File Stream
--------------

You have already read and written streams of 
characters to the ``Console``. Most of the syntax that we use for files will be very similar, using 
methods ``ReadLine``, ``WriteLine``, and ``Write`` in the same way you used them for the ``Console``.

When you read/write a file in C# program, the data processed is seen as a **Stream**.
A stream is a sequence of bytes of data sent between the destination and the source of 
the file. Streams are how data is read and written to and from files, networks, and 
computer memory. For example, printing data using a printer involves sending a sequence 
of bytes of data to a stream associated with a network port connected to the printer. 


File handling process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different task processes use different type of streams: text files, binary files, 
strings, and network communications are some of the examples. The basic 
stream operations include the following:

#. Creation/Opening
#. Reading
#. Writing 
#. Positioning
#. Closing


For file handling operations, there are two main streams: 

#. The **Input Stream** that is used to read data from a file (read operation).
#. The **Output Stream** that is used to write data into a file (write operation). 


The System.IO Namespace
-------------------------

Files can be handled very differently by different operating systems, but
C# abstracts away the differences and provides stream interfaces between
a C# program and files through the ``System.IO namespace`` (:ref:`namespace`). The System.IO namespace 
contains the required classes used to handle the input and output streams and provide information 
about file and directory structure. 

.. note:: 
   The `System.IO namespace <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io?view=net-8.0`_ lists all 
   the classes available for use. The `File class <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file?view=net-8.0>`_ 
   is one of the classes that provides 

One class that can be used to read and write class is the ``File`` class in the ``System.IO`` namespace. 
The ``File`` class has several useful methods for file handling. 


Simple File Handling: ``File`` Class 
--------------------------------------

Among the file handling methods is the convenience class ``File``, which provides static methods for the creation, 
copying, deletion, moving, and opening of a single file, and aids in the creation of ``FileStream`` objects. For example, 
the Create(), WriteAllText, ReadAllText() and File.Exists() can be used to perform basic file operations:

.. list-table:: Methods in File Class 
   :widths: 10 35
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Method
     - Description
   * - AppendText()	
     - Appends text at the end of an existing file
   * - Copy()	
     - Copies a file
   * - Create()	
     - Creates or overwrites a file
   * - Delete()	
     - Deletes a file
   * - Exists()	
     - Tests whether the file exists
   * - ReadAllText()	
     - Reads the contents of a file
   * - Replace()	
     - Replaces the contents of a file with the contents of another file
   * - WriteAllText()	
     - Creates a new file and writes the contents to it. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.


You should perform tests such as the following in ``csharprepl`` to get familiar with the methods: 

#. Create a file using ``File.Create``:
   
   .. code:: csharprepl

      > File.Create("MyTest.txt");   

#. Check if a file exists using ``File.Exists``:

  .. code:: 

   > if (File.Exists("MyTest.txt")) {                           
      Console.WriteLine("MyTest.txt exists"); 
     }
   MyTest.txt exists

#. Write to a file using ``File.WriteAllText``:
   
   .. code:: csharprepl

      > File.WriteAllText("MyTest.txt", "Hello, this is a test.");  

#. Read from a file:

   .. code:: 

      > File.ReadAllText("MyTest.txt");                            

      > Console.WriteLine(File.ReadAllText("MyTest.txt"));
      Hello, this is a test.

      > 


To better organize the tests above, you should copy your tests in ``csharprepl`` and use VS Code. You should 
also use a variable for the filename:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :linenos:

   using System;
   using System.IO;

   namespace IntroCSCS
   {
      internal class Ch07File
      {
         private static void Main(string[] args)
         {

               // create a file
               string path = "MyTest.txt";     // create the file in this directory
               // File.Create(path);           // let WriteAllText create the file //

               // test file existence 
               if (File.Exists(path))
               {
                  Console.WriteLine($"The file {path} exists.");
               }

               // write to the file
               string str = "Hello, I know how to writing files.";
               File.WriteAllText(path, str);


               // read the file 
               string s = File.ReadAllText(path);
               Console.WriteLine(s);

         }
      }
   }
