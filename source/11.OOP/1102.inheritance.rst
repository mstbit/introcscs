Inheritance
=================

While the design of OOP inheritance can be complex, the basic idea of inheritance is 
to **inherit fields and methods** from one class to another (reusability). 

To achieve inheritance, you design a **base class** and **derived classes**.

- **Derived Class (child)**: the class that inherits from another class
- **Base Class (parent)**: the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the ``:`` symbol.

In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the fields and methods from 
the Vehicle class (parent): [#inheritance-w3schools]_

    class Vehicle  // base class (parent) 
    {
        public string brand = "Ford";  // Vehicle field
        public void honk()             // Vehicle method 
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Tuut, tuut!");
        }
    }

    class Car : Vehicle  // derived class (child)
    {
        public string modelName = "Mustang";  // Car field
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create a myCar object
            Car myCar = new Car();

            // Call the honk() method (From the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
            myCar.honk();

            // Display the value of the brand field (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
            Console.WriteLine(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
        }
    }

There are three classes in the preceding code: Vehicle, Car, and Program. You have defined 
a ``parent`` class ``Vehicle`` with some fields and methods. When you 
want to create a class ``Car`` that would share the same information and actions, instead 
of repeating the code, you ``inherit`` the information and actions from Vehicle. Namely, 
you are creating a ``child`` class ``Car`` to reuse the code from the ``parent`` class. 

As you can imagine, you may inherit from Vehicle again when you want to create other 
similar
