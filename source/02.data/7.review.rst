Chapter Review Questions
=========================

    
#.  Which of these expressions are legal in C#?  
    Think of the results.
    Explain.  ::

        "a" + "b"
        "a" + 'b'
        "a" + 2
        2 + "a"
        "a" + 2 * 3;
        "a" + 2 + 3        
        2 + 3 + "a"
        2 + 3 * "a"
        
    Think first; try in csharprepl; reconsider if necessary.

#.  Write a single ``WriteLine`` statement that would produce output
    on two separate lines, not one.  Accomplish the same thing a second time 
    with fundamentally different syntax.
    
.. #.  What is printed?  ::

..         Console.WriteLine("{1} {0} {2} {1} {0}", 'B', 2, "or not");
    
#.  Which of these casts is necessary, and which could be left out
    (and be legal and mean the same thing)? Before testing, 
    think what the values of the variables will be
    for the first two or three::

        int x= (int)5.8;
        double y = (double)6;
        char c = (char)('a' + 1)
        int z = (int)'a' + 1;
        
      

     Write a program that prompts the user for a name (like Elliot)  and a time (like 10AM) and prints out a sentence like:  

.. code-block:: none 

   Elliot has an interview at 10AM.

.. _AdditionProblem:

Exercise for Addition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a version, :file:`add3.cs`, that
prompts the user for three numbers, *not necessarily integers*, 
and lists all three, and their sum, in
similar format to :repsrc:`good_sum/good_sum.cs`.

.. _QuotientProblem:

Exercise for Quotients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program, ``quotient.cs``, that
prompts the user for two integers, and then prints them out in a
sentence with an integer division problem like 

.. code-block:: none

   The quotient of 14 and 3 is 4 with a remainder of 2.

Review :ref:`Division-and-Remainders` if you forget the integer
division or remainder operator.
